  - The seas were calm and the ocean open
  - The stars shined brightly, guiding you safely
  - Life on this raft can be lonely, luckily you have an imaginary friend
  - Endless water, as far as the eye can see
  - A gentle breeze blows, cooling you off from the heat
  - The sun sets like fire on the water
  - The waves carry out peacefully
  - The sails are pointed east
  - A couple of strange fish swim by
  - The cities lie beneath, as if you were a bird flying high above
  - Winds are steady today
  - Another quiet stretch of ocean
  - Nothing but water in all directions
  - Currents are picking up
  - It looks like a storm to the north
  - The supplies seems to be secured
  - Another day, another endless ocean
  - Sometimes the ocean can really dance
  - There are worse things than running out of supplies
  - No sign of survivors

  - The news always talked about what the increase in pollution could cause
  - The skyscrapers are now failing to reach out of the water
  - Powering the future with steam and steal. Now there is only water
  - Who knew there was this much water frozen in the artic
  - The sky once blackened with soot now reflects on endless waters
  - These mighty factories are now only enjoyed by the fish
  - The inventions meant to propel us into the future now drown us all
  - In the endless ocean, you're both a master and prisoner of the tide
  - Echoes of whistles and factory bells drift faintly beneath the water
  - These blueprints and rusted gears are now treasures
